# javascript-snek-pit
A multiplayer snake game made in Javascript with node.js

# Hello
This is a small project that I made while learning  to use javascript for server-side development and node.js. It was fun:)

To run this project, you need to install sockets.io in the server directory ("npm install sockets.io"). To run the client, go to the frontend folder in your terminal and type "npx live-server". To run the server, in your terminal, type "npx nodemon server.js".

I based this projects off of this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppcBIHv_ZPs&t=2187s, but I've also made some changes to the code on my own.

It's very buggy and wonky at times, but it works well enough:)

Have fun:)
